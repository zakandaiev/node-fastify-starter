I want you to generate a production-ready SQL seed script for a table.

Here are the requirements:

1. Current table migration:
<CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...>
2. Rules for generated data:
   - Generate realistic data for each column (e.g., UUIDs for IDs, unique values for unique columns, meaningful strings, random numbers/dates within valid ranges).
   - Include realistic date/timestamp values:
       - Past, current, and future records.
       - Certain columns (e.g., finished/failed flags) should respect logical rules based on dates.
   - Include randomness where appropriate, but deterministic patterns for testing are welcome.
   - Ensure all constraints (primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, not nulls, etc.) are satisfied.
3. Data distribution:
   - Certain days or records can have higher density (e.g., 1–3 "heavy" days per month with more records).
   - Other records can be sparse, but overall the dataset should look realistic.
4. Flags and statuses:
   - Any numeric/boolean flags should follow realistic distributions.
5. SQL compatibility:
   - Must work in <DB_TYPE (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL)> via standard query execution (no DELIMITER, no procedures if possible).
6. Seed cleanup:
   - Include a DELETE statement at the end to safely remove all test data generated by this seed (use a consistent prefix or marker in relevant columns to identify test data).
7. Optional enhancements:
   - Different time-of-day distributions (morning, day, evening)
   - Staggered future/past dates
   - Deterministic heavy records for predictable UI testing

Output:
- A ready-to-run SQL script that inserts multiple realistic records into table from migration example.
- A corresponding DELETE statement to remove all test records.
- Use placeholders for dynamic columns or values where necessary.

Please generate a fully working SQL seed script based on these instructions.
